Dev Team :Nashion Dove & Scott Rsaza
After talking it out with prof phillip , the app stack will be a MAMP stack ,  , mac os, apache, MySql, PHP .
THE php will be used to connect DB and perform functions on the DB 


Here is the goals we need to hit 
1 create the same code in th main js , but in react 

2 create the connection between backend & react app

3: create a function that loops through each product in the product table 

4: have that same function spit out each product as an object that can be added 

5: have function that selects object based on what user clicks

6: edits object 

7: redisplays said object back onto the screen 

8: MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL OF THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE TO WORK ON ALL OBJECTS
